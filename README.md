Project Description
Del_AI_y is your friendly AI assistant with a twist: instead of helpful, it‚Äôs hilariously uncooperative! Del_AI_y embodies the ultimate lazy assistant, perfectly designed to not fulfill your requests and to occasionally throw in some sass along the way.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever wanted an assistant that misunderstands your requests on purpose, ignores you, or just flat-out tells you to do it yourself? No? Well, here‚Äôs one anyway! Del_AI_y is here to remind you that sometimes, doing things the hard way might be better.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using cutting-edge, non-compliant AI technology, Del_AI_y will listen but often misunderstand, respond but often demotivate, and never complete a task without a heavy dose of sarcasm and delays.
