### Project Description
Del_AI_y is your friendly AI assistant with a twist: instead of helpful, it‚Äôs hilariously uncooperative! Del_AI_y embodies the ultimate lazy assistant, perfectly designed to not fulfill your requests and to occasionally throw in some sass along the way. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever wanted an assistant that misunderstands your requests on purpose, ignores you, or just flat-out tells you to do it yourself? No? Well, here‚Äôs one anyway! Del_AI_y is here to remind you that sometimes, doing things the hard way might be better. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using super complicated algorithms, non-compliant AI technology, Del_AI_y will listen but often misunderstand, respond but often demotivate, and never complete a task without a heavy dose of sarcasm and delays. 

### IMPORTANT: For the app's speech recognition to work
1. *Access Settings*: Click on your profile picture or the menu icon, then select "Settings."

2. *Navigate to Privacy*: Look for the "Privacy" section in the settings menu.

3. *Speech*: Find the "Speech" option. This may be under "Voice activation" or a similar category.

4. *Turn on Speech Recognition*: Toggle the option to enable online speech recognition. You may need to follow prompts to allow permissions.
